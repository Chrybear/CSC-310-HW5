When the program is ran, the user will be presented with a list containing 3 actions and 1 exit command.
The commands will do the following:
1: Asks the user to enter the number of disks to be put on a tower of Hanoi. The user must enter a number > 0. If the user enters a number <= 0 it will loop and continuously ask the user to input a number within the parameters.
After the user has entered the number of disks, it will then print out each moves of disks between pegs to arrive at all pegs in ascending order on peg C.
2: Will begin taking input from the user to create a binary tree. Inputs must be entered in the order of root, left, right. To signify the end of a branch, the user should type “Y/y” when prompted “Is this the end of the node? Y/N”. After entering the node value or signifying the end of a node, the user will be asks if they are finished. ‘Y/y’ to stop adding values. If anything else is entered the loop will continue asking for inputs into the binary tree.
3: The program prints the in-order and pre-order traversal of the last user entered binary tree. If a binary tree has not been created yet, it will let the user know that one must be made before it can be traversed.
0: Exits the program.
